
2017: Adam MacMurray found that in his environment, he needed an additional ,key field, for Domain.  Script and mof imported edited for that circumstance.

2014: The clients I personally support all use EN-US as the language (1033); if you use another language on your operating system, naturally the language reflected will differ.  For any reports, etc. where I mention "Administrator" in a report, replace with your local Language's spelling of group names.

2014: The script uses a ! as a delimiter; if you happen to have account names which use a ! in their name itself, this quirk of the script will skew your results for reporting.  You may want to edit the script, and use a different delimiter on lines 107, and 135

A couple sample reports:

Report #1:  Since most of the time, "in general" people mostly care about local Administrator group, ... Members of the local Administatros group for a specific computer

select lgm.name0 [Name of the Local Group]
,lgm.Account0 [Account]
,lgm.Category0 [Category of Account]
,lgm.Domain0 [Domain for the Account]
,lgm.Type0 [Type of Account]
from v_gs_localGroupMembers0 lgm
join v_r_system sys1 on sys1.resourceid=lgm.resourceid
where lgm.name0 = 'Administrators'
and sys1.Netbios_Name0 = 'ComputerNameHer'

Report #2:  "users which are unexpectedly in the local Administrator Group"
select lgm.name0 [Name of the Local Group]
,lgm.Account0 [Account]
,lgm.Category0 [Category of Account]
,lgm.Domain0 [Domain for the Account]
,lgm.Type0 [Type of Account]
from v_gs_localGroupMembers0 lgm
join v_r_system sys1 on sys1.resourceid=lgm.resourceid
where lgm.name0 = 'Administrators'
and lgm.type0 = 'local'
and lgm.category0 = 'userAccount'
and lgm.account0 not in ('Administrator','Guest')
order by sys1.netbios_name0, lgm.name0, lgm.account0

Report #3:  This is the most complex; but gets you a lot of complicated information.  PRESUMING you have daily hardware inventory and daily run the baseline, using "about 3 days old ish" as a guesstimate for "reliability", this would show a vague reliability of the information returned, based on 3 days as the delimiter for that.
